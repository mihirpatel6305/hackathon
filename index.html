              <p>The geometry of an orbiting object in space is a circle (or an ellipse) but confined to a plane. To better understand the geometry of several orbiting objects, we need to investigate the orientation of each of the orbiting planes. The orbit of one object can be measured by an angle relative to another plane, called the inclination. The other plane is called the reference plane. The measurement of inclination is an angle. Figure 1 shows the Moon's orbit around the Earth; the reference plane is the Earth's orbit around the Sun, called the ecliptic plane. The Moon's orbital plane is inclined 5o in relation to the ecliptic plane. By using the geometry of planes, students will understand the monthly and yearly progression of the Moon around the Earth and the Earth around the Sun.</p>

                <p>Most years have four eclipses: the minimum number of eclipses in a year; 2 of these four eclipses are always solar eclipses. While rare, the maximum number of eclipses that can take place in a calendar year is seven.
                    
                    The lunar month is the period it takes the Moon to go through all the Moon Phases from a New Moon to the next, and it lasts, on average, 29.5 days. This is five days less than an eclipse season. Therefore, there will always be at least one New Moon, resulting in a solar eclipse, and at least one Full Moon, resulting in a lunar eclipse, during each eclipse season.</p>

           <p> Eclipses occur in patterns. The Saros Series is a period of 223 lunar months that has been used to predict eclipses for thousands of years. In a Saros Series, exactly 9 years, 5.5 days after any lunar eclipse, a solar eclipse will occur, and vice versa. Approximately 6585.3211 days, or 18 years, 11 days, and 8 hours after one eclipse, the Sun, Earth, and Moon return to about the same relative geometry, and a nearly identical eclipse occurs. These similar eclipses are part of the same Saros Cycle, and the time between the two eclipses is called a saros.</p>
